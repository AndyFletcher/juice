    <h1><em>Juice</em> the javascript web framework</h1>
    <p>Stop writing your logic twice. Juice removes the context switch between
    client and server code by using the same language — and code — in both
    places.</p>

      <h2>Why use Juice?</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Javascript is fun.</h3>
          <p>If you enjoy working in javascript, then you'll enjoy Juice. If you
          don't, you probably won't get much out of it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Lower barriers.</h3>
          <p>With your client-side and server-side code in the same language,
          your development won't hit as many communication blocks or gear
          changes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3><em>Planned</em> Share code between client and server.</h3>
          <p>Common helpers and validation routines written only need writing
          once and can be used in your controllers, templates and client-side
          code.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3><em>Planned</em> Document-oriented database out of the box.</h3>
          <p>Or a relational database, if that's your bag. We prefer the first
          choice, even though we've never tried it.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <h2>Getting started</h2>

      <p>The easy way is to wait a couple of weeks until we've sorted out
      packaging up binaries. The hard way is to install several things, some
      from source. If you're that desperate, come ask us for help in IRC.</p>

      <p>Juice is an open source project under the
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT license</a>.</p>
