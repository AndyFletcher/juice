Juice? JavaScript? WTH?

A server-side Javascript webframework built on top of the JSGI protocol. Well,
the version 3 proposal[0] using the built in asynchronous Zest[1] HTTP server.

If you like JS as a language, and clearly I do, then hopefully you'll get on
with Juice:

    var juice = require('juice');
    var app = new juice.Application;

    app.controllers.index = {
      return {
        status: 200,
        headers: {},
        body: ["Hello Juicers!"]
      }
    }
    app.actions = { "/?" : { action: "index", raw: true } };
    exports.app = app.setup();

There's more to it than this obviously -- a getting started guide will be
available with version 0.1 which is due for release on 20th Oct. 2009.

Juice is currently known to run on Flusspferd[1], and should run on other
CommonJS platforms in the future -- it just hasn't been tested yet.
